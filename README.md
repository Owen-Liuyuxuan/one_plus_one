## üéÆ Game Overview

**1+1 Hand Game** (also known as "Finger Game" or "Number Hands") is a traditional two-player strategy game where players use numbers on their hands to outmaneuver their opponent. The goal is simple: get both of your hands **finished** (showing ‚úó) to win before your opponent's hands are finished.

## üéØ Game Rules

### Basic Setup
- Both players start with **[1, 1]** on their two hands
- Players take turns making moves
- Each hand displays a number from 1-9, or ‚úó when finished

### How to Play

1. **Select Your Hand**: On your turn, click one of your active hands (not ‚úó)
2. **Choose Target**: Click one of your opponent's active hands
3. **Addition**: The opponent's hand value is added to your selected hand
4. **Special Rules**:
   - If result **= 10**: That hand is **finished** (shows ‚úó)
   - If result **> 10**: Hand value **resets to 1**
   - If result **< 10**: Hand keeps the new value

### Winning Condition
**Finish both of your hands** (both showing ‚úó) to win!

### Strategy Tips üí°
- Plan ahead: Consider how your move affects future possibilities
- Force difficult choices: Put your opponent in positions with no good moves
- Protect your hands: Don't let opponent's both hands get close to 10
- Use the reset rule: Sometimes going over 10 (resetting to 1) is advantageous
